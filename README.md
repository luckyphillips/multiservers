# multiservers

This is a script I wrote to help me automatically connect and control multiple servers at once. 
Hopefully, it will help others with the same issues.
Have tried to make it as simple to use as possible. If you find errors in the scripts array usage, sorry, but only had a day to write it.
Use at own risk. If needed, I can clean it up on request.
Don't forget to "chmod +x multiservers.sh"
